# markfish
Over-enginnered blog hosting server for somereason (also prolly the fastest)

## Why ??
One fine day i find that something known as gleam exists, a functional type-safe language which runs on the erlang vm (BEAM), so i get into the rabbit hole, watch a few FP videos, read about Lambda math and so on, 

Meanwhile i was also reading about how rsync works, and then i thought, "Why not try to build an over-engineered syncing algo??"

This has no real-world usages that i know (unless you wanna sync GBs worth of markdown files for some reason), directly sending kbs worth of data is waayy to simple and convinient
