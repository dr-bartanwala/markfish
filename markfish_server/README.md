# markfish
Over-enginnered blog hosting server for somereason ?(also might be the fastest)

## Why ??
One fine day i find that something known as gleam exists, a functional type-safe language which runs on the erlang vm (BEAM), so i got into the functional programming rabbit hole, watched a few FP videos, read about Lambda math, found out what YCombinator is... bla bla bla

Meanwhile i was also reading about how rsync works, and then i thought, "Why not try to build an over-engineered syncing algo which is also a blog??"

This has no real-world usages that i know (unless you want to sync a million, gigabyte sized markdown files for some reason, even in this case it will prolly crash in the current implementation), also its really simple

The main motivation behind this project was to learn FP patterns, and stuff
